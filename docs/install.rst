Installation
============

The quick and dirty way to install SnakeMD is to use pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install snakemd

If you'd like access to any pre-releases, you can also 
install SnakeMD with the :code:`--pre` flag:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install --pre snakemd

Be aware that pre-releases are not suitable for production
code.
